        <h1> Reflection </h1>
        <p> <strong>A</strong>s my final year at Mizzou draws near, it is interesting to look back on my growth as a student. My study techniques have adapted into something much more solid than in my previous years. High School, unfortunately, does not prepare students particularly well for college, especially when a student does not struggle during their high school years. While I started college using traditional study methods (such as using flashcards), I soon found that was not the correct way of studying for me. I am much better suited to studying by annotating the notes taken during class, and then attempting to teach someone the concepts I am being tested on—even if that means I end up telling the legend of Gilgamesh to my cat. This understanding of my learning style has greatly aided my ability to understand and internalize important concepts from my classes, as well as raise my grades. Additionally, I had to adjust my inadvertent ability to procrastinate and not do my homework until the day it was due. This was a particularly difficult challenge to overcome, but I discovered that if I sat down immediately after class to begin my work, it not only helped me develop better homework and study habits, but I understood the lessons better and was getting my work done early (giving me more time to do extra readings for class). Overcoming my procrastination has greatly aided in my study habits, and these practices have become second nature to me. </p>
        <p class="indent"> I have greatly enjoyed all of my courses so far. If I had to alter anything, it would be that I did not know Public History would be my major when I began, and so I had been focusing on different requirements for graduation. Originally I was planning on a degree in Ancient Mediterranean Studies, so I was not on-top of the classes I would need to take for my current degree until last semester—the start of my junior year. Over all, I believe that I have made smart decisions for my courses and other pursuits outside of school. I currently hold high GPA, and will continue to raise it over this next year until I graduate. I believe that I have set myself up well for my future plans and career goals. </p>

        <h1> Career Goals </h1>
        <p class="indent"> My plans for the start of my career begin out of the United States. I hope to attend University of Liverpool in England, where I will pursue either a Masters or a PhD in Archives and Records Management or Archival Sciences. I plan on working part-time at an archive or library as I attend university in order to keep active in my field and bolster my resume. Once I graduate, I plan on remaining in the United Kingdom and acquiring a job at an archive, and possibly transitioning to full-time at the archive I would be working in during school. My hope is that I will find a permanent job at an archive that will let me focus on my preferences, which are working in research and/or their digital imaging lab. I am still undecided on the type of archive that I will look at applying for, but the further back in history their records go the more “in my element” I will be. </p>
        <p class="indent"> In all honesty, I do not presume to know that this career outline will be my future. Human nature requires an element of change, and the amount of time that this plan encompasses ensures that things will change—including my focuses in the field. I do not know what will happen, if I will attend a different graduate school, or what I will end up specializing in. What I do know is that, wherever I end up, I will remain passionate about my field and will be a passionate and involved member of whatever community I am a part of. I believe that uncertainty in the future is, by and large, part of what makes life enjoyable—what do you think? </p>
