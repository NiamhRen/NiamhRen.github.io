        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, all. My name is Niamh Johnston and I was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri. <br/>I have loved to read since I was a child, and my mother was the one who encouraged me to develop my vocabulary and to never stop reading. Thanks to my parents (and, I must admit, a particularly well-written podcast set in an archive), I now have a deep connection to literature that has brought me to my career pathâ€”pursuing archival and library sciences. As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as having been raised by two democratic defense lawyers, I have always been an activist and passionate about standing up for human rights. Due to this being a fundamental and important part of my background, tied with my passion for history, I am pursuing a degree in archival sciences so I can study history through the lens of the people living at the time, and breathe life into their stories so they are not forgotten or hidden away.</p>
