                        <h3>CoMo Industry Standard (COMO IS)</h3>
                        <p>i.	Robert’s Rules of Order/Templates</p>
                       <p>ii.	Aiding in a start-up nonprofit organization by being a board member as secretary, aiding in communication between board members and between the organization and our partners, scheduling and agenda items</p>
                       <p>iii.	Secretarial skills, organization, adaptability</p>
                        <p>iv.	Description: I have been working as the secretary for CoMo Industry Standard (name subject to change) since September of 2021 as their formal secretary and member of the board. My duties include taking official meeting minutes, formatting all documents correctly, sharing minutes with board members, alerting the board of upcoming meetings and their agendas, sending cancellation of meeting and removal from board notices, formatting all necessary templates for communication, reserving the spaces for the board meetings (if applicable), and aiding in the presentation of this nonprofit for the community in order to start conversations about the organization and gain support, as well as aiding in the organization of any possible fundraisers and communication with potential sponsors in the future. Our goal is to create a support for those people working in the food service and entertainment industries who are struggling with mental health issues, drug addiction, not having insurance, and not being able to take mental health days off from work due to staffing and money issues. We want to ensure that “the industry” in Columbia will become a safe space for employees, and to create a better form of communication between employers and employees so that the employers might better hear the concerns of their staff and rectify any issues. Our goal is to help people in the industry who are in bad situations to get the help they need and seek help, without concern for expense—as that is what keeps many people from getting the help they desperately need. While focusing currently on Columbia area food and entertainment workers, our hope is to expand the group we can help as we gain more funds and support.</p>

                        <p>i.	Self-paced scheduling, note organization</p>
                        <p>ii.	Research and analysis skills for sources/articles, ability to thoroughly vet sources</p>
                        <p>iii.	Critical Analysis and annotations, ability to locate primary sources</p>
                        <p>iv.	Deeper understanding of transgendered and gender neutral figures in medieval/ancient history and their subsequent erasure from literature</p>
                        <p>v.	Description: As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and a gender neutral person myself, I want to learn more about the non cis-gendered people in history, who they were, and why we have so little knowledge and evidence of them. My goal with this paper is to learn more about when and why the evidence of non-traditional persons were wiped from the history books and records, and (more importantly) to uncover them and bring them into the light so they might not be forgotten. This is a personal research paper, and I am conducting it in my free-time. I will potentially reach out to former and current professors to aid in my ability to locate primary sources—as this will be the largest obstacle in my research. I will be utilizing as many databases as possible, as well as Ellis Library, our university library, as it may contain reference books that will aid in my fact-checking and further discovery of both primary and secondary sources.</p>

I aid in the researching of topics relating to Boone County history, and assist with processing and cataloging new acquisitions, take inventory of collections, update artifact records in PastPerfect, and prepare artifacts for exhibition. I am learning how to operate the METIS scanning system with Nikon camera to take high quality digital images of glass plate negatives and oversized books, handling glass plate negatives with protective glass, describing archive materials in digital processing. I aid in the identification of accurate information in photographer logs and research relevant resources in order to verify information, and input metadata using Microsoft Excel.
