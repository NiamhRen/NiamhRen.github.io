They are carving a pumpkin while smiling at the camera. Surrounding them are four images on each side, eight total, each depicting a different art piece the author created. They are brightly colored faces of women, the back of a man hanging upside-down, a person riding a skateboard, and an unidentifiable grey and purple creature.">
