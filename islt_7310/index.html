    <p>This website is dedicated to showing you, my potential employer or graduate school application board, how I will be the perfect fit for your institution if chosen. While you look through the pages on this website, my hope is for you to gain a comprehensive overview of not only my skills and experience, but also my passion for this career path. I hope to demonstrate my knowledge of web design, as well as my background in Public History, my experience in organization, aiding start-up nonprofit organizations, and my ability to do in-depth and well-cited research. My hope is for you to understand what I will be like as an employee or a student, as well as getting to know a bit about me as a person along the way. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope you will keep me in mind in the future. Enjoy! </p>
