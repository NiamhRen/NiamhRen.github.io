    Hello, all! My name is Niamh Johnston and I am a Public History major and a Women and Gender Studies minor. I have no previous experience, and actually know very little about anything tech-related (I only learned how to update my phone myself last year). I have no expectations for this course, as I am trying to come in with an open mind and learn without thinking I will be bad at it immediately, as is my default setting for anything math, science, or tech-related. I hope to use these skills in any archiving jobs I am able to land in the future, as that is my dream career and with all the advances today it is beyond necessary for archivists to have a background in web design and other basic tech. My favorite hobby is reading or art, and I have no free time but I like to think I would volunteer at an animal shelter and go on hikes if I had the time.
